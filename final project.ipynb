In this first module we will focus on an explicit finite difference method.  In [previous discussions](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc/blob/master/lessons/04_spreadout/01_Heat_Equation_1D_Explicit.ipynb), we've learned that explicit schemes have stability requirements but they are easier to understand and is how we will be introducing second order hyperbolic PDEs.  In the next module, we will graduate to an implicit method that is more complicated, but is unconditionally stable! "
